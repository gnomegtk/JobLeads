Develop a software that can be used to calculate statistics about the tax income of a country. The country is organized in 5 states and theses states are devided into counties.

Each county has a different tax rate and collects a different amount of taxes.

The software should have the following features:

- Output the overall amount of taxes collected per state
- Output the average amount of taxes collected per state
- Output the average county tax rate per state
- Output the average tax rate of the country 
- Output the collected overall taxes of the country

Please use the MVC pattern in your implementation and implement two different datasources of your choice.

This p≈ïoject uses Symfony 4.3.4.

To configure the database edit the file.env.

To create the database run the commands: php bin/console doctrine:database:create
To create all the database structure: php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
